Run the command, `git clone https://github.com/samliu21/Chess`, in terminal, and navigate to the downloaded folder.

Calling `python main.py` within the downloaded folder will get the program running!

### Right hand side bar
On the side bar, you can find options to:
- Restart
- Return to main menu
- Pieces takes by each side
